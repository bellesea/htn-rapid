If you'd like to explore further, there are a few partially built components you can complete/use to help you customize your website day-of:
- [confetti.js](/components/confetti.js): Click for some dog confetti!
- [contact.js](/components/contact.js): Make use of MUI's icons to create a social media icons bar
- [form.js](/components/form.js): Make POST requests to the Google Forms endpoint and bypass the UI completely
